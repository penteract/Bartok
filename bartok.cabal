version:             0.1.0.2
-- synopsis:
description:
  Bartok is a card game where it is possible to change the rules.
  .
  This library contains functions to allow players to build their own rules.
  .
  When implementing rules, they should be well behaved, and interact well with other well behaved rules:
  .
      The set of players must not be modified (except on 'PlayerJoin' or 'PlayerLeave'). They may be rearranged, which will affect turn order but not seating order (so a change to turn order is not immediately obvious to players).
      .
      A rule should call either the inner ruleset or 'illegal' with the event it was passed and a potentially modified GameState
      .
      If a rule awards penalty cards, this must occur before invoking the inner rules. A rule is allowed to call the inner rules multiple times to work out whether a penatly should be awarded, but should add penalty cards to the original state, then call the inner rule again before returning.
